I will write only advantages and cons and feedback Advantage-Amoled display.-Always on display (I compromised but it's there)-5000 Mah battery and runs 2 days.-Fast charging and 15W charger in the box.-Wide angle camera is awsum.-No heating no lagging.-Face unlock is very fast.-Mainly look is stunning.....-Very low radiation-Blue light filter-Lock screen story and stunning pics.Cons-Little slippery in hand but trust me a 99 Rs cover solved it straight away.-Online availability.(Now in stock)-No splash proof (as per the other reviews as I am not going to test this anyway?Feedbackfeedback-People say camera but I find it's too good.-People say speaker. One in the bottom is loud  and clear enough.-People compare with Mi but forget that China model with LCD display and 0.9 SAR value. M30 has SAR of 0.43After Using for 1 week-All well and amazing.-Working in Telcos with lost of calls phone still has 30% batt on second day. To add i have played game for 30 min and watched online movie for 3 hrs on Jio cinema along with hectic job schedule.

Ritvik Rai,"I just picked up an amazing phone which is Samsung m30 and I'm so happy to make the right decision.Talking about this phone, this comes with great battery life and I can strem all my favourite songs and play games without worrying that it may go off. The camera is very good, captures great pics doesn't let me down. My friends take my phone and go on clicking selfies. I already have 400 plus photos in my gallery. The storage capacity is not a worry either, thanks to the 128gb varient.The display is really very good. Everything so bright and nice. It is not at all heavy and the gaming performance is great. I'm loving it! :)

Aman Darji,"A Samsung's new launched M30 Smart phone is very cool because of the Infinity U AMOLED Fhd + Display is looking very nice. 13 MP ultra - wide dual camera & a triple camera setup capture which is clearly so cool with one of the best photography & great selfies. One of best part is that the battery lasts long since it has massive 5000 mAh battery & also 3x Fast Charge. Storage its also an important factor. It has 4GB RAM | 64GB internal memory expandable up to 512GB, it means you have sufficient space where you can downlod videos, movies, songs and data. Next is, it has Dual SIM slots and a dedicated slot for memory card.Samsung M30 hasExynos 7904 Processor1.8 GHz Octa Core Processor & 4GB RAM - multitask gaming, videos, etc.

Aidan Dsilva,"Very good screen clarity, it looks very neat and appealing, Camera is very good, low light photography is excellent. Fingerprint sensor is fast and it has good speed which helps me switch between apps smoothly. Gaming on this phone is awesome and it doesn't lag while playing games like PUBG and NFS. The 5000mah battery helps me almost never run out of charge . The charger included with the phone charges my phone in a matter of minutes. The AMOLED display helps me see clearer images and lets me watch movies in high definition.The Dolby digital feature helps me listen to music in high quality sound with a beautiful infinity V cut display the phone looks better than anyone. I love it

Bittu,"I was lucky enough to get this Amazing device in the very first sale on 7th March and that too my desirable variant ! üòä The delivery was also fast. Thanks to Amazon ! üëçThe phone is definitely a True Value For Money as it offers great specs along with great features with an attractive price tag. Let me organise my views about this amazing phone  as follows...LOOKS : üîéüì≤üëçThe mobile is definitely an eye-catcher due to its Premium finish, Slim body, Bezel less screen and the Double shaded back panel (I got a Gradation Blue Variant for me !)The volume and power buttons are placed rightly and are easy to access.CAMERA : üì∏ üëçIt has 16 MP + 3 MP + 3MP Triple camera which captures Amazing shots !With 7 different modes, you can choose the best one according to the scene being clicked. There's a button for Wide Angle which instantly widens the scene to be captured. I have attached the shots of the ceiling with and without Wide Angle Mode. Besides, the stickers and beauty modes work superb to get attractive selfie too.DISPLAY : üì±üëç6.4 inch Super AMOLED display is brilliant and a small U shaped notch adds to the attraction of its infinity display... The touch and interface is super smooth too and the brightness level is very efficient. You don't need to set it to full brightness when you are outside even in the afternoon.MULTI TASKING : üìöüëçWith it's huge 6GB RAM and 128GB Storage, it's very easy to perform as many tasks as you want without any lag. The phone performs flawlessly without any lag or heating. You can activate Pop up window setting and it will make your Multi Tasking lot more easy and interesting too.BATTERY : üîãü§îBattery sure is a huge one, i.e.5000mAh, but I didn't feel it sufficient enough to last for 24 hours even. Maybe, it's due to network issues or maybe I have to watch it again after some more charge cycles.Though, Fast charging from it's 15 watt charger (type C port) is indeed capable of charging the phone really fast.EXTRAS : üìùBesides all those stated above, I would like to add some more bullet points...üëçüîπThe Face recognition works great ! There's a lighting animation around the front camera while it tries to identity your face. Looks nice.üîπ Fingerprint sensor is quick and responsive. You can activate a setting after which you can scroll down the notification tray by sliding your finger on the Fingerprint sensor only !üîπ The audio quality of the speaker and the earpiece is good. Though, I felt it a bit low when I recorded my voice on star maker app.üîπ Has dedicated slots for 2 Sims and 1 Memory card.üîπ Packed with all the needed sensors.üëéüîπI found no option of assigning a SIM to a specific contact.üîπ The back panel is plastic and it's kind of finger print magnet.üîπ The Do Not Disturb function doesn't mute the phone completely though it says so. Instead, I click on the Speaker icon to mute in notification tray.üîπ No Gorilla glass protection for the display.üîπ It's not water resistant.üîπ It doesn't have an Always On Display.üîπ No Slow Motion video recording feature.üîπ Runs on Android 8.1. Don't know when will it get the Pie update.Overall, I feel it is an Amazing phone in this price and I am very satisfied with it's overall performance. It completely justifies it's price. I would strongly recommend this device to everyone looking for a Superb mobile in a moderate budget. Go for it and Thank me later ! üòä

If you buy this phone from Amazon then it will not be replaceable and returned because a smart check app made for phone performance checking,  it always shows right in all parameters. In this way you won't be able to replace / return this phone. So I suggest Dont purchase this phone Samsung Galaxy M30 from Amazon if it defective found it won't be replaced

Nitish Singh,"First things first,The phone is not for everyone. You may be thinking you should get a gaming phone at this price. But it is not.However, the good news is that there are other good phones in this price range if you are looking for a gaming device and especially looking to buy it for playing PUBG. Trust me, do not buy this phone if you are into gaming.So, who should buy the device? Any non-gamer user who loves other aspects of the phone such as a display, battery, camera and so on.DisplayThe display is the most stunning feature of the Samsung M30. It is vibrant and simply stands out. I compared it with my POCO F1 and found it more vibrant, clear and with a punchy contrast. But that doesn't mean POCO F1 display is bad. At 15K, you are getting one heck of a deal when it comes to the display.Another thing that I noticed is the great body to screen ration. It almost covers the whole screen.Processor and RAMAs we said earlier, the processor is not up to mark when it comes to running heavy apps such as games. But for an average user like me and you, who love to do calls, read messages and run the basic application, the phone will be more than enough. It will not go slow while using the available RAM(4GB in my case).Battery5000mAh battery is super awesome! It is another selling point for the phone. If you are looking for a big battery then the phone is for you. Also, the processor and OS are optimized for each other which makes the battery last longer.CameraI didn't test camera that much. But, it does look nice. You can take nice photos. But the camera does not perform best in low light conditions which is okay for a phone priced at 15K.OSI tried Samsung OS for the first time. I found it pretty decent, but not outstanding. You need to navigate multiple times for basic features. But, the good thing is that the UI will help you navigate and you will eventually find the option that you are looking for.In shortDisplay: One of the bestBattery: 5000mAh, more than enough for heavy one day use. Can easily last two days for normal users.Processor + RAM: Great for normal users, not great for gamers.OS: DecentOverall rating: 8.5/10

Ankur,"I have chosen this product over other mobiles in this price range for below reasons :1. Big battery(5000mah -others have only 4000mah)2. Triple card slot(believe me this matters though we tend to ignore this point but for those who use double sim ... we would definitely need to use both sims and one memory chip)3. Super amoled display (again other mobiles simply don't have it)4. Fast charging + fast charger in-the- box5. Wide angle camera- useful for big family photos6. Samsung trust factorNow after using our fire two full days below are pros and cons I found :Pros:---------1. Battery - Simply awesome. I first charged it yesterday 9.30 AM (100%). Since I did below tasks throughout yesterday and today and it went to 10% today at 6.44 PM  ( so 1 day & 9 hrs) :  ‚ñ™ Audio calls  ‚ñ™ video calls  ‚ñ™ internet browsing  ‚ñ™ listening to songs (headphone and speaker both)  ‚ñ™ watching movie (Netflix) and YouTube  ‚ñ™ setting up phone( usual setting for a new phone - so basically screen was on)  ‚ñ™ playing games( asphalt 9, dead target,  fruit ninja) - all games ran without single stutter2. Screen- simply beautifulBeing amoled display it show very deep colours which u won't see in normal fhd lcd/tft displays.As soon as u will see other mobiles without amoled u will notice the difference.3. UI is smooth and gestures are nice.4. Always on display gives our result premium look ( though our drains battery faster)5. Headphone quality is very nice6. Call quality is also very nice( the most important feature of any phone but we least bother about it nowadays üòâ)7. Charging time nice for 5000 mah battery- 2.15 hrs >> 10% to 100%)8. Camera is decent (not the best int this price range)Cons:---------1. Processor works fine though but i felt slight stutters here n there (but fortunately it worked really nice for three games i played as mentioned above)2. Camera doesn't perform well in low light conditions) [but works great in day light]Till now i m seriously enjoying using this phone even people in my office are appreciating our thanks to its stunning display.For me its truly practical phone for my requirement as I m not a serious gamer but i will post  updated review on 18th before its next sale on 19th so that u can decide if this phone is for you or not

kavin,"¬†Got a faulty Samsung M30 phone.After two weeks of using found that the camera stopped working.Camera Issue:When we click on camera icon blank screen is coming.Lag issue:Sometimes on touching on any icon an evident delay is happening.With all these issues reported given to service centerThings done in service center: - Updated OS - Replaced cameraStill the issue is not fixed.Now they told they will replaced the panel and check. Still haven't found any problem. When requested for replacement with all these valid problems not replacing the faulty phone.Very rude people working for Samsung customer care.

No external damage. Just went black,and touch was still working. Worse customer service but finally got my refund (replacement wasn't even available) today. It also has a crap processor. It lagged when switching apps. Go for note 7 pro,way better buy than this.

Urmi Bhatt,"When it comes to Samsung M30, you know you're in a good deal. From the display to the look of it, I love every single bit of it. The blue gradient color is one to look out of for. When it comes to using it, you have a power packed device in your hand. Powered with Android 8.1, it is the latest one in the market making it already a favourite. When it comes to RAM, it handles it all. The camera is pretty impressive and the display is an infinite making it amazing to view at. The battery life on the other hand, is long enough letting you do whatever you want to. Even if the battery is low, it charges up extremely fast enough to enjoy your phone once again. The fast charger is a unique and a must have one. The camera has all the settings of that a professional camera, making it an amazing option to have. I highly recommend this for all students

Its Battery which is 5000AmH, does not seem powerful battery, it's performance is equal to 2800-3000AmH battery, it get s drained very fast watching videos. If you charge its battery 100% then it comes down 97% within 30 minutes without using the phone.Camera quality is also not good, there is no sense of rear triple camera.This is only Brand Tag Samsung but over all quality of this phone is not good. It is not worthwhile to o spend Rs 15000 for this ""GHATIYA"" mobile.So if somebody wants to buy M30, don't buy it. Better should go for Redmi note 7 pro/ Honor or Vivo

AJN,"Loving the m30. Super light and easy to hold thanks to its curved design. Sometimes the screen gets a little cut off at the corners but that's okay. Great customisation. Battery is pretty great. Love that the headphone Jack and the charging point is on the same end and that it has a dedicated slot. Finger print  scanner and face detection is a little dull. Can't lock my phone with finger print like I could on my Moto G5s+. Also the speaker kinda resounds, as though you were in a closed room. Also camera is pretty average, hating the beauty mode. Touch sensitivity can also be a little awkward sometimes in the corners. All in all it's a decent phone, great battery life so for basic users who don't play games sometimes or all the time. It's a great handset to have invested in. However, it suits my basic needs, so I'm all for it.

I purchased M30 again (on April 2, 2019)... The phone died again just within 2 days!! The screen turned off automatically while I was using it... I tried to turn it on thinking that this might be an accidental switch off... My phone had a charge around 57%... But when I tried to turn on, nothing happened... I plugged a charger into it, it just showed a circle with a lighting symbol (‚ö°) in it... The same thing had happened with my first M30... Now I've requested for a refund from amazon...
